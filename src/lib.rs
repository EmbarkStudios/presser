//! # `ðŸ—œ presser`
//!
//! **Utilities to help make copying data around into raw, possibly-uninitialized buffers
//! easier and safer.**
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! `presser` can help you when copying data into raw buffers. One primary use-case is copying data into
//! graphics-api-allocated buffers which will then be accessed by the GPU. Common methods for doing this
//! right now in Rust can often invoke UB in subtle and hard-to-see ways. For example, viewing an allocated
//! but uninitialized buffer as an `&mut [u8]` **is instantly undefined behavior**\*, and `transmute`ing even a
//! `T: Copy` type which has *any padding bytes in its layout* as a `&[u8]` to be the source of a copy is
//! **also instantly undefined behavior**, in both cases because it is *invalid* to create a reference to an invalid
//! value (and uninitialized memory is an invalid `u8`), *even if* your code never actually accesses that memory.
//! This immediately makes what seems like the most straightforward way to copy data into buffers unsound ðŸ˜¬.
//!
//! `presser` helps with this by allowing you to view raw allocated memory of some size as a "[`Slab`]" of memory and then
//! provides *safe, valid* ways to copy data into that memory. For example, you could implement [`Slab`] for your
//! GPU-allocated buffer type, or use the built-in [`RawAllocation`] workflow described below, then use
//! [`copy_to_offset_with_align`] to copy any `T: Copy` data into that buffer safely for use on the GPU.
//! Of course, if your `T` doesn't have the correct layout the GPU expects, accessing it on the GPU side may still be
//! unsound or at least give an error.
//! 
//! \* *If you're currently thinking to yourself "bah! what's the issue? surely an uninit u8 is just any random bit pattern
//! and that's fine we don't care," [check out this blog post](https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2019/07/14/uninit.html) by
//! @RalfJung, one of the people leading the effort to better define Rust's memory and execution model. As is explored
//! in that blog post, an *uninit* piece of memory is not simply *an arbitrary bit pattern*, it is a wholly separate
//! state about a piece of memory, outside of its value, which lets the compiler perform optimizations that reorder,
//! delete, and otherwise change the actual execution flow of your program in ways that cannot be described simply
//! by "the value could have *some* possible bit pattern". LLVM and Clang are changing themselves to require special
//! `noundef` attribute to perform many important optimizations that are otherwise unsound. For a concrete example
//! of the sorts of problems this can cause, 
//! [see this issue @scottmcm hit](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98919#issuecomment-1186106387).*
//!
//! ## Introduction
//!
//! The main idea is to implement [`Slab`] on raw-buffer-esque-types (see [the `Slab` safety docs][Slab#Safety]),
//! which then enables the use of the other functions within the crate.
//!
//! Depending on your use case, you may be able to implement [`Slab`] directly for your buffer type, or it may
//! be more convenient or necessary to create a wrapping struct that borrows your raw buffer type and in turn
//! implements [`Slab`]. For an example of this, see [`RawAllocation`] and [`BorrowedRawAllocation`], which you
//! may also use directly. The idea is to create a [`RawAllocation`] to your buffer, which you then borrow into
//! a [`BorrowedRawAllocation`] (which implements [`Slab`]) by calling the unsafe function
//! [`RawAllocation::borrow_as_slab`]
//!
//! Once you have a slab, you can use the copy helper functions provided at the crate root, for example,
//! [`copy_to_offset`] and [`copy_to_offset_with_align`].
//! 
//! ### Example
//! 
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[derive(Clone, Copy)]
//! #[repr(C)]
//! struct MyDataStruct {
//!     a: u8,
//!     b: u32,
//! }
//!
//! let my_data = MyDataStruct { a: 0, b: 42 };
//!
//! // allocate an uninit buffer of some size
//! let my_buffer: MyBufferType = some_api.alloc_buffer_size(2048);
//!
//! // use `RawAllocation` helper to allow access to a presser `Slab`.
//! // alternatively, you could implement the `Slab` on `MyByfferType` directly if that
//! // type is owned by your code!
//! let raw_allocation = presser::RawAllocation::from_raw_parts(my_buffer.ptr(), my_buffer.size());
//!
//! // here we assert that we have exclusive access to the data in the buffer, and get the actual
//! // `Slab` to use to copy into.
//! let slab = unsafe { raw_allocation.borrow_as_slab(); }
//!
//! // now we may safely copy `my_data` into `my_buffer`, starting at a minimum offset of 0 into the buffer
//! let copy_record = presser::copy_to_offset(&my_data, &mut slab, 0)?;
//!
//! // note that due to alignment requirements of `my_data`, the *actual* start of the bytes of
//! // `my_data` may be placed at a different offset than requested. so, we check the returned
//! // `CopyRecord` to check the actual start offset of the copied data.
//! let actual_start_offset = copy_record.copy_start_offset;
//! ```
//!
//! ### `#[no_std]`
//!
//! This crate supports `no_std` environments by building without the '`std`' feature. This will limit some
//! of the fuctions the crate can perform.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! An important note is that obeying the safety rules specified in the [`Slab`] safety documentation
//! *only* guarantees safety for the *direct results* of the copy operations performed by the
//! helper functions exported at the crate root (and the safe functions on [`Slab`]). **However**,
//! it is ***not*** guaranteed that operations which would previously have been safe to perform
//! using same backing memory that the [`Slab`] you copied into used are still safe.
//!
//! For example, say you have a fully-initialized
//! chunk of bytes (like a `Vec<u8>`), which you view as a [`Slab`], and then (safely) perform a copy
//! operation into using [`copy_to_offset`]. If the `T` you copied into it has any padding bytes in
//! its memory layout, then the memory locations where those padding bytes now exist in the underlying `Vec`'s
//! memory must now be treated as uninitialized. As such, taking any view into that byte vector which
//! relies on those newly-uninit bytes being initialized to be valid (for example, taking a `&[u8]` slice of the `Vec`
//! which includes those bytes, ***even if your code never actually reads from that slice***)
//! is now instant **undefined behavior**.

`presser` can help you when copying data into raw buffers. One primary use-case is copying data into
graphics-api-allocated buffers which will then be accessed by the GPU. Common methods for doing this
right now in Rust can often invoke UB in subtle and hard-to-see ways. For example, viewing a GPU allocated
but uninitialized buffer as an `&mut [u8]` **is instantly undefined behavior**, and `transmute`ing even a
`T: Copy` type which has *any padding bytes in its layout* as a `&[u8]` to be the source of a copy is
**also instantly undefined behavior**, in both cases because it is *invalid* to create a reference to an invalid
value (and uninitialized memory is an invalid `u8`), *even if* your code never actually accesses that memory.
This immediately makes what seems like the most straightforward way to copy data into buffers unsound ðŸ˜¬.

`presser` helps with this by allowing you to view raw allocated memory of some size as a "`Slab`" of memory and then
provides *safe, valid* ways to copy data into that memory.
